## Features
- üîé **Wordlist Mode:** Brute-force subdomains using any wordlist (e.g., rockyou.txt)
- üåê **crt.sh Mode:** Enumerate subdomains from certificate transparency logs
- üß† **Smart Encoding:** Automatically handles UTF-8 and latin-1 wordlists
- üñ•Ô∏è **CLI:** Simple command-line interface
- üìù **No dependencies except `requests`**

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-host-scanner.git
cd virtual-host-scanner/Virual\ Host\ Scanner
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
pip install requests
   ```

---

## Usage

### Wordlist Mode
Scan a domain for subdomains using a wordlist:
```sh
python vhost.py <domain> <wordlist>
```
**Example:**
```sh
python vhost.py example.com /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

### crt.sh Mode
Fetch subdomains from crt.sh (no wordlist needed):
```sh
python vhost.py <domain> --mode crtsh
```
**Example:**
```sh
python vhost.py example.com --mode crtsh
```

---

## Example Output
```
[+] Scanning 1000 subdomains for example.com...
[FOUND] test.example.com -> 93.184.216.34
[FOUND] dev.example.com -> 93.184.216.34
...
[+] Scan complete. 2 valid subdomains found.
```

---

## Notes
- For large wordlists (like rockyou.txt), scanning may take a long time.
- If your wordlist is not UTF-8 encoded, the script will automatically retry with latin-1 encoding.
- If crt.sh mode fails, check your network connection or try again later.
- KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C) will stop the scan at any time.
